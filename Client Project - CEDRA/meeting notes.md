## üìù Reflections

The team made strong progress on streamlining the homepage, unifying the visual style, and stabilizing components like the volunteer and donate pages. Additional time is needed for advanced features such as real-time chat UI improvements and secure backend user management.

Next steps:
- Integrate chatbot into floating UI component
- Hook up backend database for login/account persistence
- Finalize deployment with correct API keys and test Stripe payments
