CEDRA Website Project
Project Scope
The CEDRA website (Center for Educational Research/Recreational Activities) aims to empower underprivileged women through a digital platform that enhances visibility, encourages engagement, and enables secure online donations. The project will deliver a responsive, modern website for an NGO that champions economic independence for women.

The website will serve as a hub for donations, outreach, storytelling, and volunteer engagement. Core goals include:

Simplifying donation processes
Increasing awareness of women's empowerment initiatives
Enhancing user interaction via an AI-powered chatbot
Ensuring transparency and ease of navigation
Target Users

Individual Donors	Easy donation process, tax receipts, and fund usage transparency
Volunteers	Discover and sign up for opportunities to contribute
